# Gladiator-Battle-Predictor
This repository contains a project created as an assignment to Hacktiv8 FTDS course.

The project is a classification model to predict whether a gladiator will survive a battle or not given his fighting style, weapons, armor condition, battle experience, track records etc. The classification model was developed using Scikit-Learn and deployed in Hugging Face. 

User may interact with the prediction page, create their own gladiator and see whether their gladiator will survive or not.
